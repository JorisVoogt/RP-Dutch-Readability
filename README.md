# RP-Dutch-Readability

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments in our paper, *Leesbaarheid: An empirical exploration of the applicability of Dutch traditional readability formulas to texts targeting children*. The research is part of the [Research Project 2023 of the TU Delft](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project), and this is where our paper can be found.
